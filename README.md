# About Monaware

Monaware is a app build by using the [D&D 5e SRD API](https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/). D&D 5e SRD API is a api that has all data on D&D such as skills ,equipment, ect. Monaware uses all data from the monsters database. the images i got from a fill posted on the discord of D&D 5e SRD API because the API does not have 70% of the monsters images.

## Monaware development process

### Highlights

The highlight of my page from me is the comparison page as the radar charts and bar charts on this page has came out very well and i think having to data sets in one charts gave the comparison page a massive step up and make it easy for users to compare data.

### Challenges

my first challenge was with the images provided by the Api as 70% of the images was not available. To fix this i had to go to there discord were i found that another users has made a list of monster ands and URL to there images with i converted into a react import file to display the images to in the carts.

my second challenge was with the timeline bar chart with storing data so i had to set up a storage.js file to put this data in a locale json storage.
